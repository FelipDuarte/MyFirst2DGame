# MyFirst2DGame
This is a very basic and small 2D game using Unity, to learn the basics of the engine.
If you have interess in learn about 2D and 3D games too
I strongly suggest that you check out the book [Unity in Action, Second Edition](https://www.manning.com/books/unity-in-action-second-edition) it's a great book for begginers.
